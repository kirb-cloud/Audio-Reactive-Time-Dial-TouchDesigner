# Audio-Reactive-Time-Dial-TouchDesigner
This TouchDesigner project features a real-time, audio-reactive dial that rotates clockwise in sync with the music. Using the Sound CHOP, the dial reads live audio input to drive its movement, while intricate wave patterns and textures respond dynamically to the rhythm, amplitude, and frequency of the sound.
